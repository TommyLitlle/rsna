### Overview    
 
In general we just have a single image classifier, data split on 5 folds, we only trained on 3 of them, and then extracted pre-logit layer from the classifier and fed into an LSTM.
Classifier trained on 5 epochs each fold, 480 images with below pre-processing. Each epoch, each fold, we extract embedding layer (use TTA and avg embeddings) train a separate LSTM for 12 epochs on each of those - so 15 LSTMs (3 fold image models X 5 epochs), and average the predictions. 
Was a bit concerned the preprocessing filter may lose information, so trained the above again without the preprocessing filter and it did worse; but averaging both pipelines did ever so slightly better. The pipeline from first paragraph above would, for all intensive purposes be just as good as final solution, but as we needed to fix docu pre-stage 2 the two pipelines are in github and final solution.

**Preprocessing:**
- Used Appianâ€™s windowing from dicom images. [Linky](https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna/blob/master/eda/window_v1_test.py#L66)
- Cut any black space. There were then headrest or machine artifacts in the image making the head much smaller than it could be - see visual above. These were generally thin lines, so used scipy.ndimage minimum_filter to try to wipe those thin lines. [Linky](https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna/blob/a97018a7b7ec920425189c7e37c1128dd9cb0158/scripts/resnext101v12/trainorig.py#L159)
- Albumentations as mentioned in visual above. 

**Image classifier**
- Resnext101 - did not spend a whole lot of time here as it ran so long. But tested SeResenext and Efficitentnetv0 and they did not work as well. 
- Extract GAP layer at inference time  [Linky](https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna/blob/a97018a7b7ec920425189c7e37c1128dd9cb0158/scripts/resnext101v12/trainorig.py#L387) 

**Create Sequences**
- Extract metadata from dicoms :  [Linky](https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna/blob/master/eda/meta_eda_v1.py) 
- Sequence images on Patient, Study and Series - most sequences were between 24 and 60 images in length.  [Linky](https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna/blob/a97018a7b7ec920425189c7e37c1128dd9cb0158/scripts/resnext101v12/trainlstmdeltasum.py#L200) 

**LSTM**
- Feed in the embeddings in sequence on above key - Patient, Study and Series - also concat on the deltas between current and previous/next embeddings (<current-previous embedding> and <current-next embedding>) to give the model knowledge of changes around the image.  [Linky](https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna/blob/a97018a7b7ec920425189c7e37c1128dd9cb0158/scripts/resnext101v12/trainlstmdeltasum.py#L133) 
- LSTM architecture lifted from the winners of first stage toxic competition. This is a beast - only improvements came from making the hiddens layers larger. Oh, we added on the embeddings to the lstm output and this helped a bit also.  [Linky](https://github.com/darraghdog/rsna/blob/a97018a7b7ec920425189c7e37c1128dd9cb0158/scripts/resnext101v12/trainlstmdeltasum.py#L352) 
- For sequences of different length, padded them to same length, made a dummy embedding of zeros, and then through the results of this away before calculating loss and saving the predictions.  

**What did not help...**  
Too long to do justice... mixup on image, mixup on embedding, augmentations on sequences (partial sequences, reversed sequences), 1d convolutions for sequences (although SeuTao got it working)

**Given more time**  
Make the classifier and the lstm model single end-to-end model. 
Train all on stage2 data, we only got to train two folds of the image model on stage-2 data.
   
### Steps to reproduce submissions
   
Note: Run environment with Docker file `docker/RSNADOCKER.docker`.    
Note: The scripts below were run on an LSF cluster. This can be run outside of LSF, however within the above docker env, by just running the shell command within the double quotes. For eaxample, instead of `bsub -app gpu -n =0  -env LSB_CONTAINER_IMAGE=darraghdog/kaggle:apex_build "cd /mydir  && python3 myscript.py"`, just run, `cd /mydir  && python3 myscript.py`.    

   
1.  
    
    A. Run script `download.sh` to download the data to `/data` folder. For pretrained image weights we use `torchvision.models.resnet` and the checkpoint `resnext101_32x8d_wsl_checkpoint.pth`, taken from [here](https://pytorch.org/hub/facebookresearch_WSL-Images_resnext/). We also attach for your convenince.  
    B. This should also run a script `eda/window_meta2csv.py` to create meta data files. 
    
2. Create folds by executing `python eda/folds_v2.py`   
3. Convert dicoms to jpeg by executing `eda/window_v1.py`. Before doing this point the variables, `path_img` where the dicom images are stored, `path_data` at the meta file directories and `path_proc` to the directory to store the images which will be loaded to the `trainorig` script.   

4. 
    
    A. Run training of resenext101 for 3 folds for 5 epochs by executing `sh scripts/resnext101v12/run_1final_train480.sh`.     
    B. Run again training of resenext101 for 3 folds for 5 epochs by executing `sh scripts/resnext101v13/run_1final_train480.sh`.   

5.
    A. Extract embeddings for each of these runs (3 folds, 5 epochs) using `sh scripts/resnext101v12/run_2final_emb.sh`. Note, this script uses test time augmentation, and extracts embeddings for the original image, horizontal flip and transpose.   

    B. Extract embeddings for each of these runs (3 folds, 5 epochs) using `sh scripts/resnext101v13/run_2final_emb.sh`. Note, this script uses test time augmentation, and extracts embeddings for the original image, horizontal flip and transpose.   
    
6. Train LSTM on image embeddings by sequencing the images per patient, series and study : `sh scripts/resnext101v13/run_3final_lstmdeltasum.sh`   
7. Train LSTM on image embeddings by sequencing the images per patient, series and study : `sh scripts/resnext101v12/run_3final_lstmdeltasum.sh`.    

8. Bag the results of each of the LSTM runs and create submission using `eda/val_lstm_short.py`. Again, 3 folds 5 epochs, and then LSTM is bagged for the 12 epochs it runs. Here we simply average the results  of all the last LSTM file outputs. **submit2**      
9. For blending results. 

    9.1. Run another LSTM using `LSTM_submit_05.py` via: `sh izuit/LSTM_submit_05_f0.sh`; `sh izuit/LSTM_submit_05_f0.sh` and `sh izuit/LSTM_submit_05_f0.sh`. 

    9.2. Bag results using `LSTM_submit_05_bagging.py`

    9.3. Build final blend using `blend.ipynb` with alpha = .95 (best results for stage1 LB) **submit1**
